The goal was to develop a service worker (to cache our static assets) and provide a webmanifest (all information stored about the PWA).

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

To start the server, run npm start. To access the app after starting the server, go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
